Over time, the universe expanded and cooled, giving rise to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets.\n",

They come in a variety of sizes, colors, and temperatures, with some stars being much larger and hotter than others. The life cycle of a star depends on its mass, with massive stars undergoing supernova explosions at the end of their lives, while smaller stars like our Sun eventually evolve into white dwarfs.\n",

    "The search for extraterrestrial life is a central focus of space exploration, driven by the desire to uncover whether life exists beyond Earth. Scientists study the conditions on other planets and moons in our solar system, as well as exoplanets orbiting distant stars, in the hope of finding signs of life elsewhere in the universe.\n",
